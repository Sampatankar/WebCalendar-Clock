# WebCalendar-Clock
A formatted clock and calendar in vanilla JS.

My own work - NOT from a tutorial!

This app is the basis of my first portfolio project. This will be HTML, CSS, and vanillaJS.  It will be a stylised clock and calendar using the new Date() method, but will show the date and time in a more English friendly format.

The app will be added to with various links and access to my own Google calendar, to show date notifications. The app will also link to future portfolio apps, social media links, work, and hobbies.
